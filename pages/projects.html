        This picross game is inspired by <a href="liouh.com/picross2">Henry Liouh's picross game</a> 
        which I play frequently as a time killer. While still a work in progress,
        it is currently at an MVP stage and awaits further changes such as match
        history, click and drag functionality, and multiple solutions. Getting it
        to its current MVP stage took me about 2 hours of work.

        This project was done during Travelers' 24-hour hackathon, InJam. The team's goal
        was to create a modular, scalable framework for synthetic scripts that navigate
        through the Travelers website similar to a human, ensuring customers can use services. 
        This provides a level of service assurance beyond checking the service's server status,
        as just because a service's server is running does not guarantee the website is functioning
        properly. Working with 6 other Travelers employees, we made a functional MVP by the end
        of the hackathon and have been reached out to about continuing development of our idea. 
        <br><br>
        Without very limited prior knowledge of Express.JS and JavaScript, I implemented an API
        to interface with our MongoDB database. GET routes would return JSON responses, while
        POSTS accepted JSON bodies within the requests. I also developed the very first script
        for the framework, providing my team a reference point for the scripts they would develop
        further down the line. During and after the hackathon, I was praised for my willingness
        to take on challenges, my versatility, and my affinity to learn whatever I needed to.

        <br>
        This is a repository of Python scripts and functions I made while doing
        my cryptography homework. Functionality includes finding additive/multiplicative
        inverses, polynomial multiplication modded by AES irreducible polynomial, and
        the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

        This game was made as a semester-long project in a computer programming course in my high school.
        It was developed using Python's pygame module and intended to be a humorous game, hence the name comprised of 
        multiple references to internet personalities.
        The characters in the game are all video game versions of the team members, excluding Kemul and Lil' Shed.
        Originally, the plan was for everyone to program their own characters, but as we progressed in the project
        we realized it would be better for one person to do all of the characters and just have people do their own art.
        Obviously, we aren't graphic designers and hopefully none of us pursue a career in that field, but we did our best.
        <br><br>
        My contribution to the project was to code all of the characters and all of the entities that interacted with the characters, such as 
        ranged attacks, melee attacks, and health bars. This was no small feat and I had to use a lot of my own time outside of the classroom
        to write all of the code necessary. I spent hours a day writing the code and debugging others' code, and rewrote several classes that 
        were written by other people to optimize the code and make it more easily usable. For example, attack objects originally took 14 arguments 
        in their constructors and were interacting very poorly with the environment, so I rewrote it to take 3 arguments and work hitch-free. I 
        did this by attaching it to the player that initiated the attack, making it so the required values were passed automatically which drastically 
        increased ease of use as well as efficiency.
        <br><br>
        I also added several easter eggs to the game, such as a hidden Pong game that could be accessed by clicking one of the corners of the menu.
        All-in-all, the game was very fun to make and I gained valuable experience in teamwork and workflows. We were required to plan our actions 
        ahead of time, loosely simulating a real production environment, and we had meetings often to discuss the best course of action for the game.

    <h3>Schedule Bot</h3>
    <h5>A Discord bot that tracks users' schedules and events</h5>

            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This is a Discord bot a friend and I made as a solution for checking if our friends were busy
        without having to manually ask them. The bot stores users' schedules after having them use commands in
        the chat to input classes, locations, and time ranges and provides functionality to print everyone's schedule 
        as well as check who is currently free. The information is stored locally using a Python library called Pickle
        so the data would persist through bot restarts, as the bot was usually hosted by either a Raspberry Pi or on one
        of our computers.
